Men,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This table shows historical enrollment by gender and race/ethnicity from 1988–2010. The data is divided into three sections: men, women, and combined totals, with categories including Nonresident Alien, Black non-Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, and Race/Ethnicity Unknown. Across the years, White non-Hispanic students consistently made up the largest share of enrollment, while growth is visible in Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black non-Hispanic populations, especially in the 2000s.

Abbreviations/Notes:

Nonresident alien = international students without U.S. citizenship or residency.

Race/ethnicity unknown = students who did not report their background.

Totals combine men and women by year.",,,,,,,,,,,

"*In 2011-12 and 2012-13, some certificates did not qualify for IPEDS reporting because the number of required credits was below the mininum for a post-baccaulaureate or post-master's certificate.  CCSU's figures does include those certificates not reported to IPEDS therefore figures will not match IPEDS reporting for those years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

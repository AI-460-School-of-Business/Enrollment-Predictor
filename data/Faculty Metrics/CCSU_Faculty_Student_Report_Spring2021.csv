,"Overview:
The Spring 2021 Excel file contains Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It summarizes teaching loads, student enrollments, and sections taught across departments, clearly distinguishing contributions from full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also reports the percentage of student credit hours taught by each group, providing insights into the instructional balance at the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Total number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of faculty workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Proportion of total student credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

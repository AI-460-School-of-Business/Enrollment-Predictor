"Overview:
The Spring 2022 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides CCSU departmental data on faculty instructional load and student enrollment. It reports the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (converted to FTEs), instructional load credits, and student FTE counts. The ratio column highlights how many students are served per FTE faculty member, offering a clear picture of instructional capacity across departments and colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

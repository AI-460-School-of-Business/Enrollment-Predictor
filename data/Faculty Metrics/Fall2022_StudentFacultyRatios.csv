"Overview:
The Fall 2022 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file summarizes faculty teaching resources and student enrollment across CCSU. It presents data on full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, instructional loads, and student full-time equivalents (FTEs). The ratio column shows how many students are supported per faculty FTE, providing a consistent measure of instructional workload by department and college.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

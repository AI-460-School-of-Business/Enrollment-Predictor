"Overview:
The Fall 2018 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file captures departmental-level instructional data at CCSU. It details full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions, expressed in instructional load credits and full-time equivalent (FTE) units, alongside student FTE enrollments. The student-to-faculty ratio highlights how instructional resources were distributed across departments and colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty in Full-Time Equivalent units (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total teaching faculty expressed in FTEs

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

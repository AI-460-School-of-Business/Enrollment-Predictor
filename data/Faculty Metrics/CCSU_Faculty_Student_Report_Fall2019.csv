,"Overview:
The Fall 2019 Excel file provides Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It details faculty teaching activity, student enrollment, credit hours, and sections taught across departments, distinguishing between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The report also highlights the proportion of student credit hours taught by each group, giving insight into instructional reliance on FT versus PT instructors.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Total number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of instructional activity)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections offered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

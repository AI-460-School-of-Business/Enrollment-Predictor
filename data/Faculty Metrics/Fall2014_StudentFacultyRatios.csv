"Overview:
The Fall 2014 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file summarizes teaching resources and workload across all departments at CCSU. It compares the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (in full-time equivalents), their instructional load, and the number of students served, ending with a ratio of students per FTE faculty. This gives a clear view of how faculty capacity aligns with student demand at both the departmental and university level.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty in Full-Time Equivalent units (total load ÷ 12)

C = FTE Faculty (A+B) – total teaching faculty converted into full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – full-time equivalent student enrollment

E = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty (D ÷ C)",,,,,,,

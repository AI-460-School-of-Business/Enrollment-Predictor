"Overview:
The Fall 2020 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides CCSU departmental data on teaching capacity and student enrollment. It compares the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their instructional loads expressed as FTEs, and the number of students served. The final ratio shows how many students each FTE faculty member supports, offering a clear view of instructional workload distribution across the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed as full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

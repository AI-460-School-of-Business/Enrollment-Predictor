"Overview:
The Spring 2020 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides CCSU’s departmental teaching workload and enrollment distribution. It compares full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their instructional loads expressed in FTEs, and student full-time equivalent (FTE) counts. The ratio column shows the number of students per FTE faculty, offering a standardized measure of instructional capacity across the colleges and the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

,"Overview:
The Spring 2022 Excel file contains Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It provides a department-level breakdown of faculty headcounts, student enrollments, course sections, and student credit hours, separated by full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The report also indicates the percentage of credit hours taught by each group, offering insights into instructional reliance across colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of total credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

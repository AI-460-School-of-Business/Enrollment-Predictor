"Overview:
The Spring 2024 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file captures CCSU’s faculty resources and student enrollment distribution by department. It shows the balance of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their combined contributions in FTEs, and student FTE enrollment. The ratio column highlights how many students each FTE faculty member supports, providing a consistent view of instructional workload across colleges and the entire university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

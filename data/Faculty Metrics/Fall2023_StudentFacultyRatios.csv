"Overview:
The Fall 2023 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file outlines CCSU’s departmental instructional workload and student enrollment distribution. It provides data on the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their combined contributions in FTEs, and the student FTE counts. The ratio column shows how many students are served per FTE faculty, highlighting instructional capacity across colleges and departments.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total FT and PT faculty expressed as full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

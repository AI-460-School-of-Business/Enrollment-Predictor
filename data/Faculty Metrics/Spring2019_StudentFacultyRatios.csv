"Overview:
The Spring 2019 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file reports on departmental teaching resources and enrollment across CCSU. It details full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty participation (converted into FTEs), instructional loads, and student FTE counts. The ratio column highlights how many students each faculty FTE supports, showing how instructional capacity varies by department and college.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total FT and PT faculty converted into FTEs

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

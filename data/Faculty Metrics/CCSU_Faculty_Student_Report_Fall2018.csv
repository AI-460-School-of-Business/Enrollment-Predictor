,"Overview:
The Fall 2018 Excel file provides Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It summarizes teaching loads, student credit hours, course sections, and enrollment figures across departments, comparing contributions of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The dataset also shows the percentage of total student credit hours delivered by each group, giving a clear picture of instructional distribution.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total number of student credit hours taught (a measure of instructional workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

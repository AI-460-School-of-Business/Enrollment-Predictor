FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Total number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total number of student credit hours taught (measure of workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Total number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Percentage of credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

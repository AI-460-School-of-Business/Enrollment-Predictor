"Overview:
The Fall 2019 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file reports faculty workload and student enrollment across departments at CCSU. It details full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions (expressed in FTE), the number of students served, and the ratio of students per faculty FTE. This ratio is a key indicator of instructional capacity and balance between faculty resources and student demand.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total FT + PT faculty converted to full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

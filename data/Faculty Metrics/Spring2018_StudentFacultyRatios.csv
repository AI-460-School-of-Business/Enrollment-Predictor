"Overview:
The Spring 2018 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file summarizes CCSU’s departmental teaching resources and student enrollment. It tracks both full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions (in FTEs), their instructional load, and student FTE counts. The student-to-faculty ratio column highlights how many students are served per FTE faculty, offering a consistent measure of instructional capacity across the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty converted into full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

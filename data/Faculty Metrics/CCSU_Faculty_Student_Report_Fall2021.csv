It summarizes departmental teaching loads, student enrollments, course sections, and credit hour distribution between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The report also shows the share of student credit hours taught by each group, highlighting instructional reliance across colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of faculty instructional workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average number of student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Percentage of total credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

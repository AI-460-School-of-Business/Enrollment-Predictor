,"Overview:
The Fall 2022 Excel file presents Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It outlines teaching activity across departments, including faculty headcounts, student enrollments, credit hours, and course sections, separated by full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The report also shows the percentage of total credit hours taught by FT versus PT faculty, giving a clear picture of instructional balance.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of teaching workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students taught by faculty

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of total credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

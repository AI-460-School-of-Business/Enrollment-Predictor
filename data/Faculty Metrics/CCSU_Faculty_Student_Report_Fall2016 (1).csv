It outlines credit hours taught, student enrollments, and course sections delivered across academic departments, comparing contributions of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also highlights the percentage of total student credit hours delivered by each faculty type, providing insight into instructional balance.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total number of student credit hours taught (a measure of teaching activity)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in the faculty’s courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students taught per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of individual course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of total credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,

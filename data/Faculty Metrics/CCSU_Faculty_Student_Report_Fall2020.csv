,"Overview:
The Fall 2020 Excel file presents Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It summarizes faculty headcounts, student credit hours, sections taught, and enrollment across departments, broken down by full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also shows the percentage of credit hours taught by each group, giving a clear view of instructional reliance across colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of instructional workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Proportion of credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

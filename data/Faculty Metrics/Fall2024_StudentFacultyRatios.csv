"Overview:
The Fall 2024 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file details CCSU’s distribution of faculty resources and student enrollment across departments. It reports the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their combined full-time equivalents (FTE), and student FTE enrollments. The student-to-faculty ratio illustrates how many students each FTE faculty supports, serving as a key measure of instructional workload and capacity by college and for the university overall.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

"The Spring 2025 Totals Excel file shows school-level aggregates of faculty teaching load and student credit hours (SCH). It breaks down credit hours taught by full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty across each college, along with FTE enrollment, ending with a university-wide total. Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

SCH (Student Credit Hrs) = Total student credit hours taught, a measure of teaching workload

FTE Enrollment = Full-Time Equivalent enrollment, converting all student course loads into an equivalent full-time basis

Total Student Credit Hrs = Combined FT and PT student credit hours",,,,,

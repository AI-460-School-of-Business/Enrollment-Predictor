Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Percentage of total student credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

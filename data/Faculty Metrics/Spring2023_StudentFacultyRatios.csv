"Overview:
The Spring 2023 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file presents CCSU’s distribution of instructional resources and student enrollment. It reports full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions in FTEs, instructional load credits, and FTE students by department. The ratio column illustrates how many students are served per faculty FTE, providing an important indicator of teaching workload and capacity across colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed as full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

"Overview:
The Spring 2016 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file presents departmental data on instructional resources and student enrollment at CCSU. It compares full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions (in FTE), instructional load credits, and full-time equivalent (FTE) student counts. The ratio column provides a standardized measure of how many students each FTE faculty supports, making it easier to evaluate instructional capacity across departments and colleges.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent units (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

,"Overview:
The Spring 2025 Excel file provides Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It breaks down instructional data by department, showing faculty headcounts, student enrollments, sections taught, and credit hours divided between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The report also highlights the proportion of credit hours taught by each group, illustrating trends in faculty workload distribution.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (indicator of workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average number of student credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average student enrollment per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections offered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of total credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Overview:
The Fall 2015 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides department-level metrics of faculty teaching loads and student enrollment at CCSU. It compares the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (in full-time equivalents), the instructional load carried, and the number of students served. The ratio of students to FTE faculty offers a clear benchmark of instructional coverage and workload distribution across schools.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Total Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined full-time and part-time faculty converted to FTEs

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed in full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

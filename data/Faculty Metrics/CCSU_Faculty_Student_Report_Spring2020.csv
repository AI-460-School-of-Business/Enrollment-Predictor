,"Overview:
The Spring 2020 Excel file contains Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It provides a department-level breakdown of faculty headcounts, student enrollments, course sections, and credit hours taught, distinguishing between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also includes the percentage of student credit hours taught by each group, allowing comparisons of instructional contributions.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty members teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (workload measure)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Proportion of total credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

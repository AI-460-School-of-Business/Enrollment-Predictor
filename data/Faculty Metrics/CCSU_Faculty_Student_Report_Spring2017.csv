,,,"Overview:
The Spring 2017 Excel file presents Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It captures faculty teaching loads, student credit hours, student headcounts, and sections taught across departments, with clear separation between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also provides percentages showing the distribution of credit hours taught by each group, allowing for analysis of instructional balance.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of teaching workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average student credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students taught per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections offered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of total student credit hours delivered by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,

"Overview:
The Spring 2021 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file summarizes CCSU departmental faculty resources and student enrollment. It compares full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty contributions (in full-time equivalents), instructional load credits, and student FTE enrollments. The student-to-faculty ratio highlights teaching capacity across colleges, showing how many students are supported per FTE faculty member.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total FT and PT faculty expressed as full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

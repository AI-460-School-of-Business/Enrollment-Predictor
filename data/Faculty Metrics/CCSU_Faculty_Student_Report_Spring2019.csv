,"Overview:
The Spring 2019 Excel file presents Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It details faculty teaching loads, student credit hours, headcounts, and course sections across departments, distinguishing between full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty. The file also highlights the percentage of total credit hours taught by each group, providing insight into instructional reliance on FT versus PT faculty.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average number of student credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in faculty-taught courses

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students taught per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Share of credit hours taught by full-time versus part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Overview:
The Spring 2018 Excel file contains Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It breaks down faculty workloads, student enrollments, course sections, and credit hour distribution across departments. The data is reported separately for full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, showing their proportional share of total student credit hours.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of teaching load)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours per faculty member

Student Headcount = Total number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students taught per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections offered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Percentage of total student credit hours delivered by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

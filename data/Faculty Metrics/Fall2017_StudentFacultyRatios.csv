"Overview:
The Fall 2017 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides a department-level breakdown of instructional resources at CCSU. It compares full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (converted to full-time equivalents), instructional load credits, and student full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollments. The final column shows the ratio of students to faculty FTE, giving a clear picture of teaching capacity across colleges and the university as a whole.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent units (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total faculty expressed as full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment converted to full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

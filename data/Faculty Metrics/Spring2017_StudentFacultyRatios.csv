"Overview:
The Spring 2017 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file provides CCSU’s departmental breakdown of teaching resources and student enrollment. It compares the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (converted to FTEs), instructional load credits, and student full-time equivalents (FTE). The ratio column shows the number of students per faculty FTE, giving a clear picture of instructional capacity across colleges and the entire university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty expressed in FTEs

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

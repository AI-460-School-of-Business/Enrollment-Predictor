,"The Fall 2015 Excel file presents Central Connecticut State University’s Faculty & Student Credit Hour, Student Headcount Report. It outlines faculty teaching loads, student credit hours, headcounts, and course sections taught across departments. The data is broken down by full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, with percentages showing the distribution of credit hours delivered by each group.

Abbreviations Explained:

FT = Full-Time (faculty employed full-time)

PT = Part-Time (faculty employed part-time)

Faculty Headcount = Number of faculty teaching courses

Student Credit Hr = Total student credit hours taught (measure of instruction workload)

Credit Hr/Faculty = Average credit hours taught per faculty member

Student Headcount = Number of students enrolled in courses taught

Student Headcount/Faculty = Average number of students taught per faculty member

Sections Taught = Number of course sections delivered

% Credit Hr by FT Faculty / PT Faculty = Proportion of student credit hours taught by full-time vs. part-time faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,

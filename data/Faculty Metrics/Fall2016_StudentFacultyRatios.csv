"Overview:
The Fall 2016 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file presents teaching and enrollment metrics by department at CCSU. It includes the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty (in full-time equivalents), instructional load credits, and student full-time equivalents (FTE). The student-to-faculty ratio provides a standardized view of instructional workload across colleges and the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent units (PT Total Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – combined FT and PT faculty in full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment converted into full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

"Overview:
The Spring 2015 Student–Faculty Ratios Excel file outlines teaching load and student enrollment by department at CCSU. It shows the number of full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) faculty, their instructional load credits, and total student full-time equivalents (FTE). The ratio column highlights how many students each FTE faculty member supports, providing a key measure of instructional workload across the university.

Abbreviations Explained:

Facfile FT = Full-time Faculty (headcount)

A = Full-time Faculty with Instructional Load Credits

B = Part-time Faculty expressed in Full-Time Equivalent (PT Total Load ÷ 12)

C (A+B) = FTE Faculty – total FT and PT faculty converted to full-time equivalents

D = FTE Students – student enrollment expressed as full-time equivalents

E (D/(A+B)) = Ratio of Students to FTE Faculty",,,,,,,

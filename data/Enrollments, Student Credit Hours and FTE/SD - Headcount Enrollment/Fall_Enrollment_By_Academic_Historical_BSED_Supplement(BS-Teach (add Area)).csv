Program's School,Department,OHE,CIP,Program Name,Concentration,Area,Major/pre-major,N,N,N,N,N,"This table provides program-level enrollment details split into majors, pre-majors, and totals across Fall 2020–Fall 2024 for selected CCSU departments. It shows how many students are formally in the major, how many are in the pre-major stage (preparing or seeking admission), and the combined totals.

Key Findings by Department

Art & Design (Art Education)

Totals remain steady (44 ? 54), with most students consistently counted as pre-majors rather than fully declared majors.

English (BS-Teach)

Declined overall (59 ? 46).

The pre-major population drives most of the fluctuation (45 ? 39), while the direct major line is much smaller (14 ? 7).

History (BS-Teach)

Increased from 87 ? 91, with a strong pre-major pipeline (65 ? 62).

Suggests stable interest in teacher-prep pathways for History.

Music Education (BS-Teach)

Declined over time (38 ? 26) but shows signs of stabilization.

Majority of students remain in pre-major status each year.

Spanish (BA & BS-Teach combined)

Totals slipped from 8 ? 14, with pre-majors accounting for most of the enrollment.

Remains small compared to other language programs.

Elementary Education (multiple tracks)

Overall decline from 322 ? 254 across all emphasis areas.

English track dropped from 154 ? 118, Mathematics track from 80 ? 55, while History track actually grew (36 ? 45).

Heavy reliance on pre-majors (often 60–70% of totals).

Special Education (BS-Teach)

Only shows up by Fall 2024 with 3 students total, suggesting a very small pipeline at the undergraduate level.

Physical Education (BS-Teach)

Declined modestly (100 ? 89), though rebounded from a low in 2022.

Pre-majors consistently outnumber declared majors.

Dance Education (BS/BS-Teach)

Recovered after declines (18 ? 19), with most growth in pre-majors.

STEM Teacher Pathways (Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Math, Physics, Tech/Engineering Ed)

Remain very small programs (usually single-digit enrollments).

Technology & Engineering Education dropped from 33 ? 17 but stabilized in the last two years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
